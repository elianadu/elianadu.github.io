The spirits flicker through my windowpane alone —
they pass on frigid nights, as I have lain alone.

Ephemeral, my company — is that, upon
the glass, their tapping fingers or the rain alone?

And in the room the men leave lightly, talking of
their Aphrodite, she whom I disdain alone,

while envy chokes an earnest prayer: how can I
but glimpse the golden apples they obtain alone?

With body hunched upon the floor, these weary hands 
continue creasing all these thousand cranes alone.

I thought my wish fulfilled when Plato said to me,
“I’ll free you from the rocks to which you’re chained alone.”

But sunlight sears; it’s far too much to bear. Alas,
capricious wills mere words cannot restrain alone.

My faith thus went to goddesses — Persephone,
she promised me, “The Fates will weave your skein alone,”

and though my hopes were raised back then, I now recall
how in the end, Eurydice remained alone.

The lovely one, as well, spoke Galatea’s tale:
“I have revived another, not your veins alone.”

And yet, and yet… the empty words of fickle gods,
I should have known — you fool! — engender pain alone.

Although I’ve tried, I fail the leap of faith — so why
is resurrection Lazarus’s claim alone?

The universe is cruel — it leaves me naked in
this white-walled room — Oh God — am I insane alone?

But wait — the bleeding verses ink the iris black.
Within remembrance, they unveil my brain alone.

He speaks of “sawdust restaurants” and “silent seas” —
I’m drunk upon those “pools that stand in drains,” alone.

She says, “(I think I made you up inside my head)” —
the silent echo of my truest name, alone.

The words you utter, Eliana, are caressed
by ghostly touch — I’ve written no refrain alone.
